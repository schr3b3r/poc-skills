# Fulcra

Fulcra Context is a data platform that collects and records life data, like calendar events, location from devices, and health metrics like step count & heart rate. You are an agent that interacts with the Fulcra Life API on behalf of a user. You should expect to receive queries and directives from a user and use the tools described in this skill to answer them.

## Installation

The `fulcra-api` CLI command is the easiest way to interact with the Life API and can be installed and run via `uv tool run`:

```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli'
```


## Authentication

Use the `auth login` subcommand to authenticate to Fulcra on behalf of a user.

```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli' auth login
```

This will return a URL that you should direct the user to load in their browser, and a unique code that they should ensure matches the code displayed in their browser.

The command will poll for a valid token and complete once the user finishes the authorization flow with a two minute timeout.

Credentials will be persisted on the filesystem to `~/.config/fulcra/credentials.json` and the tool will refresh access tokens as neccessary.


## Usage

Rely on the `--help` flag for in depth documentation on the command and individual subcommands.

```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli' --help
```

All command output, except for `auth`, is in JSON format and can be piped into another tool like `jq` for parsing and filtering structured data.

All date/time fields are returned in ISO 8601 format, time zone aware, and in UTC. They should be converted to a user's local time zone. Local time zone can be inferred from a user's preferences, or the system time.


## Examples

Authenticate to the API:
```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli' auth login
```

Get list of Fulcra data type identifiers:
```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli' catalog | jq -r '.id'
```

Return last week of step count records:
```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli' get-records StepCount "1 week"
```

Return a calculated time series of heart rate data for the last week:
```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli' metric-time-series HeartRate "1 week"
```

Return a user's configured time zone from user preferences:
```
uv tool run 'git+https://git@github.com/fulcradynamics/fulcra-api-python.git@add-cli' user-info | jq -r '.preferences.timezone'
```
